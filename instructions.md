## Instructions

Welcome to the Two Sums problem. Your goal is to complete all of the issues outlined in the issues tab of this repo.

### Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
Some list of numbers generated may not have a solution at all and some may have multiple, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Rules:
1) generator.py may NOT be modified in any way.
2) You can solve this anyway possible but if you solve it to the specification of one of the issues in the repo then good going!
3) Clone main.py as a starting base for your solution
4) More than one person can publish solutions to this problem

Please add your answers to the "src" directory with the filename "UOS_ID.ISSUE_NAME.py"
